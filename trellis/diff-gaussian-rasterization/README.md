# Build Instructions

1. You need to have a working CUDA 12.4 and VS2022 installed. 
2. The pytorch is already installed in the poetry environment.
3. Run the following command in the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022:

```bash
set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
poetry run python setup.py bdist_wheel
```


# Differential Gaussian Rasterization

Used as the rasterization engine for the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields". If you can make use of it in your own research, please be so kind to cite us.
