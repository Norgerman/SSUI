- **Reproducible**: Scripts, its necessary modules, and the SSUI itself are versioned. Scripts can be run in the exactly same environment as the script author.
- **Management**: Manage your models and configurations 
- **Strong Typed**: All resources (include models) are strong types and can be prevented from being misused.
